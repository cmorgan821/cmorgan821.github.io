					<div class="card-footer">Chris Morgan has a good eye for design and offers good alternatives and suggestions. He is easy to work with.  CMA did a two car garage addition and major exterior facelift. The garage looks like it has always been there. All elements of the exterior facelift came together in perfect harmony. Project costs are established up front, other than any agreed upon changes in scope of work as the project progresses, so there are no surprises.</div>

Chris was helpful and accessible throughout the whole project, which is very important.  The project went as well as it could have and we loved working with the people at CMA.  If you are looking for a designer/builder, we highly recommend CMA.</div>

					<div class="card-footer">My wife and I hired Chris Morgan after interviewing several builders and architects. Chris was prompt and responsive and had a lot of experience working on similar homes in our neighborhood. Our kitchen renovation included moving supporting walls and had many hidden challenges that Chris was able to overcome keeping us informed along the way of the various cost and timing strategies. We lived in our second floor throughout the project and the crews' tidiness and professionalism was greatly appreciated. We would hire Chris again, no question.</div>

The coat closet is also important to us – finally our coats are off of the floor!  We don’t know what we would do without it!  Thanks for your work on this.  We enjoyed having you and the entire crew at our home.  Everyone was friendly in addition to doing great work.</div>
